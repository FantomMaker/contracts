# Fantom Maker Contracts
Fantom Maker is the first launchpad and incubator focused solely on the Fantom Opera blockchain, with the goal to enrich the entire Fantom ecosystem through the incubation and launch of quality projects.

Combining transparency and a community-oriented launchpad, Fantom Maker aims to make their projects accessible to everyone. Indeed, the FM team will personally invest in all the projects they launch, to ensure the goals of the community, and their own, are perfectly aligned. Because it is often very costly to meet the investment requirements of most launchpads, access to newly launched projects is limited to big investors. This high barrier to entry excludes many members of the growing crypto community. They solve this problem by making sure that each of the holders will get a part of the allocation of the projects raised on the launchpad. There will be a small percentage of the allocation reserved for non-holders as well.
